This is my EECS 120B final project for the summer of 2017. In this project i created a juke box with the ability to play three different songs depending on the button you press. It utilizes a LCD screen to display the current song being played and the main menu. I use six LED's to dance to the rhythm of the song. I also use the built in PWM of the ATmega 1284 micro controller to convert the frequencies to the buzzer. 

In the code i have state machines to start and stop the song as well as play 3 different songs. I use arrays containing prequencies and note lengths for each song. I also hold the note delays in an array. The light show is also contained in an array. I coded piece by piece and it easily helped aid in completing faster since i didnt have to worry about as many errors.
